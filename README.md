A basic Cisco Pscket Tracer Project. Implemented a smal city network where we have three areas with different routing protocols RIP, EIGRP and OSPF.
the three areas are connected to a central router where i have used redistribution to combine all three routing protocols. 
also implemented a firewall to the servers so that devices outside ti the area cant send packets to the server.
